function in js 
A function in JavaScript is a block of code that performs a specific task. Instead of writing the same code multiple times, we can define a function once and reuse it whenever needed.

Functions make code organized, reusable, and easy to manage.

Funciton Declaration?
A function with a name can be call before and after it declaration and it is fully hoisted

Function Expression?
A function store in a variable and we can't call before its defination and it is not fully hoisted

Higher Order Function?
A function take a another function in arguments and it return a function as itself

Arrow Function ?

A Arrow Function is a modern way to write a function its make code easy to understand and make flexiblity
and it is not fully hoisted we can access only after declaration function and we cannot invoke this function before declaration.
Arrow functions (=>) are a shorter and cleaner way to write functions in JavaScript. They were introduced in ES6 and help make code more concise
