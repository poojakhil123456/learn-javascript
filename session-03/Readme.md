 i have learn about that what is operater , how its work and how many types operaters in javascript. Session 
 In JavaScript, operators are special symbols or keywords that perform operations on values (operands). Operators allow you to manipulate data,
 perform calculations, and control program logic. 

 Types of JavaScript Operators.
    
 JavaScript provides several categories of operators , each serving a different purpose:
 
 1. Arithmetic Operators – Perform mathematical calculations (+,-,*,/,%)
 2. Assignment Operators – Assign values to variables (=,+=,-=,*=)
 3. Comparison Operators – Compare two values (==,===,!=,>,<)
 4. Logical Operators – Perform boolean logic.(&&,||,!)
 5. Bitwise Operators – Work on binary numbers (&,|,~,<<,>>)
 6. Ternary Operator – A shorthand for conditional expressions (?,:)
 7. Type Operators – Determine the type of a value .

 some other Advanced operater

 1. Dot Operator (.) - The dot operator (.) is fundamental in JavaScript for accessing object properties and invoking methods.
 2. Nullish Coalescing Operator (??) - The nullish coalescing operator (??) assigns a default value only if the left-hand operand is null or undefined.
 3. Spread Operator (...) - The spread operator (...) is used to copy, merge, or expand arrays and objects.
 4. Rest Operator (`...`) - The rest operator (`...`) collects multiple function arguments into an array.
 5. Comma Operator (`,`)- The comma operator evaluates multiple expressions and returns the last one.

 Data Types in JavaScript 

 In JavaScript, a data type defines the kind of value a variable can hold. JavaScript has two main categories of data types:

1. Primitive Data Types (Immutable, stored by value)
2. Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types (Mutable, stored by reference)

1. Primitive Data Types(Stored in Stack Memory)

- String
- Number
- Boolean
- Null
- Undefined
- Symbol
- BigInt

2. Reference Data Types (Stored in Heap Memory)

- Object
- Array
- Function
- Date
- Map
- Set

Type Conversion (Type Coercion) in JavaScript
Type conversion (also known as type coercion) in JavaScript is the process of converting values from one data type to another.

1. Implicit Type Conversion (Type Coercion)
JavaScript automatically converts data types when needed.

2. Explicit Type Conversion (Manual)
You can manually convert data types using built-in JavaScript functions.
